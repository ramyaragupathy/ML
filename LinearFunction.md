## Linear Functions

A simple, straight line is more clearly defined as a linear function. All linear functions can be written in the following form:
y= mx + b. For a specific linear function m and b are constant values while x and y are variables.
y = 3x + 1 and y = 5 are examples of linear function.

Constant m determines how steep the line is.
- When m equals 0, the line is completely flat  and is parallel to x.

- When m and b are both set to 0, line is equivalent to x-axis.

m-value controls a line's slope while the b value control's y-intercept. y-intercept is the value where the line intersects the y -axis.
Slope determines the steepness of the line. When m is set to positive value, y value increases as the x value increases.When m value is set to negative, y-value decreases as x-value increases. When m is 0, y value is consistent throughout and is equivalent to the y-intercept

Slope is called the rate of change. Rate of change is how much y-axis changes for a specific change in x-axis

m = change in y/change in x .

Slope calculation between points (1, 4) and (4, 13) for the equation y = 3x + 1

m = (13-4)/(4-1) = 9/3 = 3

Rate of change between any two points in a line is always equal to the function's slope.

## Nonlinear Functions

y = -x^2 + 3x -1 is a nonlinear function. It is not represented by a straight line. It's represented by a curve.

Output y of a nonlinear function is not proportional to input values x. An increment in x doesn't result in a constant increment in y.
Whenever x is raised to a power not equal to 1, we've a non-linear function. A few examples:
```
y = x^3
y = x^3 + 3*x^2 + 2x - 1
y = 1/-(x^2)
y = sqrt(x)
```
Slope changes between two points. When we calculate the slope between 2 points on a curve, we're really calculating the slope between the line that intersects both of those points.
