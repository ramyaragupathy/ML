## Descriptive statistics
- Constructs
- Operational definition
- variables
- lurking variables/Extraneous factors
- population
- sample
- population parameters (mu)
- sample statistics (x bar)
- sampling error(mu minus x bar)

A bigger sample will better approximate population parameters
- Sample randomness
  - Random distribution
- Dependent variable/Outcome
- independent variable/Predictor variable
- Correlation/association does not imply causation
- Golden Arches theory of Conflict resolution by Thomas Friedman
- Relationships - observational studies, surveys
- Causation - should be a controlled experiment
- surveys - response bias, non response bias
- controlled experiment
- random sample vs convenience sample_list
- blinding
- placebo
- double blinding
- within subject design
- Methods of research
  - Observational studies
  - surveys
  - Experiments for proving causality
- Frequency table
  - absolute frequency vs relative frequency
- proportion between 0 and 1
- percentage between 0 and 100%
- interval/bin/bucket
  - bin size - interval in which you're counting frequency
  - histogram vs bar paragraph
  - smaller bin is better to see the shape of histogram
- histogram used only fro quantitative/numerical data
- bar graph used for categorical or qualitative data
- shapes of distribution
  - uniform distribution
  - normal distribution (bell curve)
  - skewed distribution
- From frequency table histogram can be drawn but you can't plot frequency table from histogram
- Mode - most frequent
  - no mode possible
  - multi-modal: more than one mode

## Inferential statistics
